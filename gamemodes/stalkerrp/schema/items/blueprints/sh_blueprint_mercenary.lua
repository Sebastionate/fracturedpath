ITEM.description = "A guidebook authored by retiring Blue Eagle technicians intended to teach new arrivals on how to maintain and create their armors. Interestingly, it seems like they borrow concepts and designs from both their time fighting Monolith and the Military, as well as innovations created by their on again off again Freedom allies. The end results put them at an advantage over most other factions."
