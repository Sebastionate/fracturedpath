It combines a closed cycle breathing system and an integrated system of anomalous field suppression with an adequate ballistic vest. This suit is widely regarded as a good choice for overall protection. Still, it is expensive, and those who prefer pitched battle over careful anomaly investigation are advised to look elsewhere.\n\nBallistic Protection:\nSkull: IIA\nNeck & Face: II\nTorso: III\nLimbs: IIA\nWeight: 2"
